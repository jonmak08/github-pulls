#Building locally

This branch has changed to using Electron and Redux with React (using the [Electon React Boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) setup).

To build locally, follow the following steps:
1. Run `npm install` from the root of the project
2. Create two terminal tabs/windows/panes into the directory
3. In the first, run `npm run hot-server`
4. In the second, run `npm run start-hot`

I ideally want to eliminate the multiple window requirement (or at least reduce it).

I'll flush this out more soon :)
