#Building locally

This branch has changed to using Electron and Redux with React (using the [Electon React Boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) setup).

To build locally, follow the following steps:
1. Run `npm install` from the root of the project
2. Run `npm run dev`

I'll flush this out more soon :)
